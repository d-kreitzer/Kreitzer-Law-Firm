## Advanced Database Management Course - Final Project

Welcome to our GitHub repository showcasing our final project for the Advanced Database Management course. This project involves the development of a sophisticated database system designed to simulate a law firm environment. We focused on addressing real-world challenges in database management. Below are the key aspects of our project:

## Project Overview
- Developed a database system to simulate a law firm's operations.
- Applied practical knowledge in **database design**, **query optimization**, and **performance tuning**.
- Aimed to bridge the gap between academic learning and practical application.

## Database Design and Development
- Created mock data to accurately represent a law firm's operations.
- Designed a comprehensive database structure with core tables for attorneys, clients, matters, expenses, and invoices.
- Implemented joining tables with unique IDs for **efficient data retrieval** and **streamlined queries**.

## Performance Evaluation and Optimization
- Conducted thorough analysis of table designs and query structures.
- Reviewed execution plans for various queries to understand the database's processing mechanisms.
- Identified and addressed areas for improvement in database performance.

## Advanced Techniques and Outcomes
- Examined different query types and their impact on the databaseâ€™s I/O load.
- Explored various indexing strategies and implemented table partitioning.
- Achieved a balance between query response times and storage requirements, improving performance for specific query types.

This project has been an enriching learning experience, providing us with practical skills in **database design**, **performance tuning**, and **query optimization**, and preparing us for real-world database management challenges.
